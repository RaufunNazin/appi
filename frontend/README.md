# What I built

1. Login, Register, Create Post, Like, Comment.
2. I implemented the likers section on hover to reduce load.
3. Only top 5 comments are fetched for reducing load on backend.
4. Posts are fetched with pagination.
5. The DB is in 3NF.
6. Pydantic validations are there to prevent bad data.
7. Used indexes to make DB query faster.
8. Password hashing and JWT authentication is implemented.
9. ORM used to prevent SQL injection.
10. Loading states and visual hierarchy implemented to improve UX.
